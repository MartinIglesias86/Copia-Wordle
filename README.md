In this project I'm going to use [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/), [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to create a game of Criptdle, with the deployment of the Smart Contract on
the Rinkeby test net.

This is my first Smart Contract and will also be my first time using React also. I hope you enjoy it!
