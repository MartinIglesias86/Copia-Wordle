# Interactve list of words for the "Criptdle" game, with words from the Crypto ecosystem.

In this project I'm going to use [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/), [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to create an app to add words to a list, with the deployment of the Smart Contract on
the Rinkeby test net.

This is my first Smart Contract and will also be my first time using React also. I hope you enjoy it!
